# Study Log of Daniel Hu
* 2021.3.29 I learn how to configure system clock and OS tick today. But I don't understand the meaning of all the functions. And I don't know how to test my code. I think I can compile my code and run it in the FPGA board after Zhu Yuqi finishing his work.

TODO:
* learn how to compile C and Cpp in VS Code in Windows
* learn how to compile the code using RISC GCC in Ubuntu
* ask for bare metal code from Zhu Yuqi
