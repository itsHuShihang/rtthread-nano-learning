# Study Log of Daniel Hu
## 2021.3.29
I learn how to configure system clock and OS tick today. But I don't understand the meaning of all the functions. And I don't know how to test my code. I think I can compile my code and run it in the FPGA board after Zhu Yuqi finishing his work.

I finish the whole process of porting the RT-Thread NANO to RISC-V. But I don't know the meaning of functions very clearyly. I think I need to read the official documents more and find the meaning of the functions. I don't know much about OS. I need to learn.

TODO:
* learn how to compile C and Cpp in VS Code in Windows
* learn how to compile the code using RISC GCC in Ubuntu
* ask for bare metal code from Zhu Yuqi
* learn about system interrupt and system clock
